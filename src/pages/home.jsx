                This site was created by participants of the hackathon held in
                October 2021, as part of an educational program to improve
                JavaScript and React development skills.

                A team of developers from around the world for two days tried to
                implement the task proposed by the organizers of the hackathon
                and maximize their technical and creative potential.
              </p>
              <p className="lead text-muted">
                To implement the project, we used the React library, the
                Bootstrap CSS framework and the best technological solutions.
              </p>
              <p className="lead text-muted">
                What we managed to do in such a short time, you can appreciate
                by clicking on the links of the site, clicking on the delightful
                buttons that delight the eye of a sophisticated viewer, enjoying
                the exquisite design of bootstrap components.
